        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Acidic base (vinegar/lemon juice)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps To Prepare: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the Peri Peri Sauce: Blend key ingredients such as bird's eye chilies, garlic, lemon (juice and peel), vinegar, paprika, oregano, and salt to create the signature spicy and tangy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Marinate the Chicken: Slash the chicken pieces to allow for deeper flavor penetration, then coat them thoroughly in the peri peri sauce. Marinate in the fridge for at least 1-3 hours, or ideally overnight, for maximum flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook (Grill/Bake/Pan-fry): Cook the chicken using a high-heat method such as grilling, baking, or pan-frying until it is fully cooked through and has a nice char on the outside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Baste and Serve: Baste the chicken with extra warmed peri peri sauce during cooking to keep it moist and enhance the flavor. Let it rest before serving hot, often with sides like fries, rice, or a fresh salad. 
        </li>
    </ol>
