    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is an Italian pasta dish that features wide,<br>
        flat sheets of pasta layered with fillings such as a meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, vegetables, <br>
        and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
    </p>

    <p>
        The assembled dish is typically baked in an oven until hot and bubbly, <br>
        with grated cheese on top. Lasagna can also refer specifically to the wide, flat noodle itself.

    <h3>Steps To Prepare: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare Ingredients: Make the meat sauce (brown meat, add sauce, simmer) and the cheese mixture (combine ricotta, egg, and seasonings).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook Noodles: Boil lasagna noodles until al dente (firm), then drain and set aside. (You can skip this step if using "oven-ready" or fresh noodles).
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble Layers: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking. Build layers in this order: noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.<br>
             Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used, finishing with a final layer of noodles topped with sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven (usually 350-375°F or 175-190°C) for about 45 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>
            Finish & Rest: Uncover the lasagna and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing to help it set. 

        </li>
    </ol>
